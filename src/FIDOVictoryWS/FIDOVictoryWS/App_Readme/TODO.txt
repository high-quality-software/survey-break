* Near to do



* Future releases



* Future Phases
- ConnectionString selector for current Environment (DEV, IT, QA, PROD)


* Funny ideas
- n-depth update record taken in care when evaluate how many records have to be sync
- Interal check to validate all input datetime are in UTC(Z)
- When making logging for user that haven't trials assgined then fail with accordingly message


* Discarted
- Configure elmah to send emails when unhandled exception occurrs

KK: Not for FIDO2.0. All we do is log errors  to log file and Elmah.  We try to set the log level to 
‘ERROR’ so only errors are logged.  I change to INFO or DEBUG if need more info  etc. Emails are hard 
to track and it from SUPPORT side.  Victory is not part of FIDO and we don’t have a support email 
address.
